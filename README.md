# Flutter Unit Testing Examples

This repository demonstrates Flutter unit testing with two examples:

1. **Normal App**: Tests the functionality of a simple counter app, including incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter value.
2. **API Call with Mocktail**: Shows how to mock HTTP requests and test API calls, including handling successful and failed responses.

### Setup

To run the tests, you need to have Flutter installed. Clone the repository and run the tests using:

```bash
flutter test
